VDE (Virtual Distributed Ethernet)

VDE is an ethernet compliant virtual network which includes tools such
as 'vde_switch' and 'vdeqemu'. VDE switch has several virtual ports
where virtual machines, applications, virtual interfaces and
connectivity tools can be virtually plugged in. VDE qemu works as a
wrapper for running qemu/kvm virtual machines that connects
transparently to a specified vde_switch
