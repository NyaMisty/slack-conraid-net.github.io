osm-gps-map (gtk mapping widget)

osm-gps-map is a Gtk mapping widget (with Python bindings) that,
given GPS co-ordinates, draws a GPS track and points of interest on
a moving map display.

osm-gps-map downloads map data from a number of websites, including
openstreetmap.org, openaerialmap.org and others, and can be used to
build desktop mapping or geolocation applications.
