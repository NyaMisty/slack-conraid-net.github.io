PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
srm: srm (Command-line program to delete files securely)
srm:
srm: srm is a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the standard rm, it
srm: overwrites the data in the target files before unlinking them. This
srm: prevents command-line recovery of the data by examining the raw block
srm: device. It may also help frustrate physical examination of the disk,
srm: although it's unlikely that it can completely prevent that type of
srm: recovery.
