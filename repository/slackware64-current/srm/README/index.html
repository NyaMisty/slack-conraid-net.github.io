srm (Command-line program to delete files securely)

srm is a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the standard rm, it
overwrites the data in the target files before unlinking them. This
prevents command-line recovery of the data by examining the raw block
device. It may also help frustrate physical examination of the disk,
although it's unlikely that it can completely prevent that type of
recovery.
