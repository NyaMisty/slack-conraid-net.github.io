ferm (Tool to maintain complex firewalls)

ferm is a tool to maintain complex firewalls, without having the
trouble to rewrite the complex rules over and over again.
ferm allows the entire firewall rule set to be stored in a separate
file, and to be loaded with one command. The firewall configuration
resembles structured programming-like language, which can contain
levels and lists.
