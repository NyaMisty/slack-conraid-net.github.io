PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
wdiff: wdiff (A wordwise implementation of GNU diff)
wdiff:
wdiff: The GNU wdiff program is a front end to diff for comparing files on a
wdiff: word per word basis. A word is anything between whitespace. This is
wdiff: useful for comparing two texts in which a few words have been changed
wdiff: and for which paragraphs have been refilled. It works by creating two
wdiff: temporary files, one word per line, and then executes diff on these
wdiff: files. It collects the diff output and uses it to produce a nicer
wdiff: display of word differences between the original files.
