gst-plugins-bad:
gst-plugins-bad: GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par
gst-plugins-bad: compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality,
gst-plugins-bad: but they're missing something - be it a good code review, some
gst-plugins-bad: documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some
gst-plugins-bad: actual wide use.
