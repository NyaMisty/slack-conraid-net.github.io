ipguard (tool to protect LAN IP adress space by ARP spoofing)

ipguard listens network for ARP packets. All permitted MAC/IP pairs
listed in 'ethers' file. If it recieves one with MAC/IP pair, which
is not listed in 'ethers' file, it will send ARP reply with
configured fake address. This will prevent not permitted host to
work properly in this ethernet segment.
