pyrit (WPA precomputed cracker)

Pyrit allows you to create massive databases of pre-computed
WPA/WAP2-PSK authentication phase in a space-time-tradeoff.
By using the computational power of Multi-Core CPUs and other
platforms through ATI-Stream, Nvidia CUDA and OpenCL, it is currently
by far the most powerful attack against one of the world's most used
security-protocols.
