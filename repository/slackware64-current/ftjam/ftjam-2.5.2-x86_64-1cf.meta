PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
ftjam: ftjam (FT Jam - an enhanced version of the Jam build too)
ftjam:
ftjam: Jam is a program construction tool, like make(1). Jam recursively
ftjam: builds target files from source files, using dependency information
ftjam: and updating actions expressed in the Jambase file, which is written
ftjam: in jam's own interpreted language. The default Jambase is compiled
ftjam: into jam and provides a boilerplate for common use, relying on a
ftjam: user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual targets and sources.
