pyte (Simple VTXXX-compatible linux terminal emulator)

It's an in memory VTXXX-compatible terminal emulator. XXX stands for
a series of video terminals, developed by DEC between 1970 and 1995.
The first, and probably the most famous one, was VT100 terminal,
which is now a de-facto standard for all virtual terminal emulators.
