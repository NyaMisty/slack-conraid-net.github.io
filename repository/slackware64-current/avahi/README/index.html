avahi (service discovery aka zeroconf)

Avahi is an Implementation the DNS Service Discovery and Multicast
DNS specifications for Zeroconf Computing. It uses D-BUS for
communication between user applications and a system daemon. The
daemon is used to coordinate application efforts in caching replies,
necessary to minimize the traffic imposed on networks. This kind of
technology  is already found  in  Apple MacOS X (branded Rendezvous
Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf) and is very convenient.
