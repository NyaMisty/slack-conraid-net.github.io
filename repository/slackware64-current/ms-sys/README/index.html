ms-sys (Program for writing Microsoft compatible boot records)

This is a Linux program for writing Microsoft compatible boot records.
The program does the same as Microsoft "fdisk /mbr" to a hard disk or
"sys d:" to a floppy or FAT partition except that it does not copy any
system files, only the boot record is written.
