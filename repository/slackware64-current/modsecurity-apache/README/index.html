ModSecurity (ModSecurity v3 Apache Connector)

The ModSecurity-apache connector is the connection point between
Apache and libmodsecurity (ModSecurity v3). Said another way, this
project provides a communication channel between Apache and
libmodsecurity. This connector is required to use LibModSecurity
with Apache.
