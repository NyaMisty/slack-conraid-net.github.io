intel-microcode: intel-microcode (Linux Processor Microcode Data File)
intel-microcode:
intel-microcode: CPU microcode is a mechanism to correct certain errata in existing
intel-microcode: systems. The normal preferred method to apply microcode updates is
intel-microcode: using the system BIOS, but for a subset of Intel processors this
intel-microcode: can be done at runtime using the operating system. This package
intel-microcode: contains those processors that support OS loading of microcode
intel-microcode: updates.
