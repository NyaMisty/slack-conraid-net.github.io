PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
ragel: ragel (State Machine Compiler)
ragel:
ragel: Ragel compiles executable finite state machines from regular
ragel: languages. Ragel targets C, C++, Objective-C, D, Java and Ruby.
ragel: Ragel state machines can not only recognize byte sequences as regular
ragel: expression machines do, but can also execute code at arbitrary points
ragel: in the recognition of a regular language. Code embedding is done using
ragel: inline operators that do not disrupt the regular language syntax.
