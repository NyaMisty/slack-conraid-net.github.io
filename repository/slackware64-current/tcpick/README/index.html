tcpick (tcp stream tracker and sniffer)

tcpick is a textmode sniffer libpcap-based that can track tcp streams
and saves the captured data in files or displays them in the terminal.
Useful for picking files in a passive way on eth and ppp interfaces.
It can store all connections in different files, and there are useful
display modes like hexdump, hexdump + ascii, only-printable etc.
