PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
twolame: twolame (an optimised MP2 encoder)
twolame:
twolame: TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder.
twolame: TwoLAME should be able to be used as a drop-in replacement for
twolame: LAME (a MPEG Layer 3 encoder). The frontend takes very similar
twolame: command line options to LAME, and the backend library has a very
twolame: similar API to LAME.
