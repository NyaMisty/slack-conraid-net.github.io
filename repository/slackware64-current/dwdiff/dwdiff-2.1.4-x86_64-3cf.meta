PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
dwdiff: dwdiff (word-level diff program)
dwdiff:
dwdiff: dwdiff is a diff program that operates at the word level instead of
dwdiff: the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows the
dwdiff: user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in that
dwdiff: it takes an optional list of characters that should be considered
dwdiff: delimiters. Delimiters are single characters that are treated as if
dwdiff: they are words, even when there is no whitespace separating them
dwdiff: from preceding words or delimiters.
