samhain (file integrity / intrusion detection system)

The Samhain host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) provides
file integrity checking and log file monitoring/analysis, as well as
rootkit detection, port monitoring, detection of rogue SUID
executables, and hidden processes.
Samhain been designed to monitor multiple hosts with potentially
different operating systems, providing centralized logging and
maintenance, although it can also be used as standalone application
on a single host.
