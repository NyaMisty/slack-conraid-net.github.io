collectd: collectd (system statistics collection daemon)
collectd:
collectd: collectd is a small daemon which collects system information
collectd: periodically and provides mechanisms to monitor and store the values
collectd: in a variety of ways. Since the daemon doesn't need to startup every
collectd: time it wants to update the values it's very fast and easy on the
collectd: system. Also, the statistics are very fine grained since the files
collectd: are updated every 10 seconds.
