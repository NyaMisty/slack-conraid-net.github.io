unicode-slugify (Python Slugifier)

Unicode Slugify is a slugifier that generates unicode slugs.
It was originally used in the Firefox Add-ons web site to generate
slugs for add-ons and add-on collections. Many of these add-ons and
collections had unicode characters and required more than simple
transliteration.
